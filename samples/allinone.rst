Frisbeetarianism
  The belief that, when you die, your soul goes up
  onto the roof and gets stuck.


Keep in mind always the four constant Laws of Frisbee:

        (1) The most powerful force in the world is that of a disc
            straining to land under a car, just out of reach (this
            force is technically termed "car suck").
        (2) Never precede any maneuver by a comment more predictive
            than "Watch this!"
        (3) The probability of a Frisbee hitting something is directly
            proportional to the cost of hitting it.  For instance, a
            Frisbee will always head directly towards a policeman or
            a little old lady rather than the beat up Chevy.
        (4) Your best throw happens when no one is watching; when the
            cute girl you've been trying to impress is watching, the
            Frisbee will invariably bounce out of your hand or hit you
            in the head and knock you silly.
